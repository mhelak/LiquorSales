# Liquor Sales Project
The aim of this project is to investigate patterns of liquor sales in the supermarket chain Hy-Vee. Specifically, the focus is on the period 2012-2020 and exclusively on Hy-Vee stores in Iowa. The ultimate goal is to forecast demand of a specific liquor, rum, as well as compare sales of this liquor at stores located in cities on the border with other sates: Nebraska and Illinois. The aim is to see if proximity to other states with different alcohol regulations affects sales in border town stores.
